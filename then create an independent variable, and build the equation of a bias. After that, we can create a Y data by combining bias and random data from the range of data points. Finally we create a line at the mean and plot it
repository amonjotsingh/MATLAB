Vectors are included in square brackets[]. Elements can be separated by space, a comma, if you want to create a row vector. Whereas, the column vector is created by separating each element by the semicolon.

%here is a row vector:
 x = [5 4 2 1 33 6];
% here is a column vector: 
y = [1; 3; 5; 7; 9];
